title: Accounts
---

Accounts are the core of the Open Payments protocol and are identified by one or
more URLs which also provide the entry-point for further interaction.

Once an Open Payments client has discovered the URL of the account on the server
they will begin using the APIs to setup the transaction they wish to complete
depending on the [use case](./p2p). All other API endpoints are relative to the
account URL.

## Resource Representation

The `application/json` representation of an account resource provides meta-data
about the account.

| Property        | Type   | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| id              | URL    | The URL identifying the account                              |
| accountServicer | URL    | The URL identifying the wallet                               |
| assetCode       | string | The asset code of the account                                |
| assetScale      | int32  | The asset scale used when expressing amounts for the account |

## APIs

The accounts API endpoint/resource URL is the URL discovered by the client
through the [discovery](./discovery) process.

### Create

Create is not supported for accounts.

### Get

The following request is a non-normative example of a request for the meta-data
for the account identified by the Payment Pointer: `$wallet.example/alice`

```http
GET /alice HTTP/1.1
Host: wallet.example
Accept: application/json
```

The returned JSON document SHOULD contain one or more of the following claims:

- `accountServicer` URL identifying the entity servicing the account (e.g. bank,
  digital wallet, mobile money provider).
- `assetCode` the currency of the account.
- `assetScale` the natural scale of the account relative to the natural scale of
  the asset. This is expressed as an integer which is the power of 10 that the
  account balance must be divided by to get to the natural scale of the asset.
  For example, if the asset is USD then a scale of 2 implies that the balance is
  tracked in USD cents. (Must be divided by 100 to be show USD)

If the Open Payments server supports authorization of clients via OAuth2 this
document MAY contain claims as defined in
[RFC8414 Section 2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8414#section-2) under a
property `auth`.

Other claims MAY also be returned.

Claims that return multiple values are represented as JSON arrays. Claims with
zero elements MUST be omitted from the response.

An error response uses the applicable HTTP status code value.

The following is a non-normative example response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": "https://wallet.example/alice",
  "accountServicer": "https://wallet.example",
  "assetCode": "USD",
  "assetScale": 2,
  "auth" : {
    "authorization_endpoint": "https://auth.wallet.example/authorize",
    "token_endpoint": "https://auth.wallet.example/token"
  }
}
```

### Payment Details

The client can also get the payment details of an account by doing an HTTP GET
of the account URL as defined in the [payment details API](./payments).

The following is a non-normative example of a client getting the payment details
for an account:

```http
GET /alice HTTP/1.1
Host: wallet.example
Accept: application/ilp-stream+json
```

with a non-normative response from the Open Payments Server of:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/ilp-stream+json

{
  "id": "https://wallet.example/alice",
  "accountServicer": "https://wallet.example",
  "assetCode": "USD",
  "assetScale": 2,
  "auth" : {
    "authorization_endpoint": "https://auth.wallet.example/authorize",
    "token_endpoint": "https://auth.wallet.example/token"
  },
  "ilpAddress": "example.alice.YB5X9FhSOUPCL~NjZjZTYwZDgtZjRiYS00YzYwLWJhNmUtZmM1ZTBhYTk5OTIz",
  "sharedSecret": "6jR5iNIVRvqeasJeCty6C+YB5X9FhSOUPCL/5nha5Vs="
}
```

## Simple Payment Setup Protocol Fallback

Open Payments is designed to be backwards compatible with the previous
Interledger setup protocol
[SPSP](https://interledger.org/rfcs/0009-simple-payment-setup-protocol/).

SPSP defines the behaviour of an SPSP Server when receiving an HTTP `GET` at the
URL decoded from a Payment Pointer and using an `Accept` header value of
`application/spsp4+json`.

Open Payments is explicit that this URL represents an account resource and
defines a different behaviour for the default media-type of `application/json`.

Since all known SPSP Server implementations will reject such a request, this
behaviour is backwards compatible with SPSP.

If an Open Payments client makes a `GET` request (using the `application/json`
media-type) and receives an error this suggests that the server is a legacy SPSP
server and does not support Open Payments.

If a raw Interledger connection is sufficient to accomplish the transaction it
is attempting, the client MAY fall back to using SPSP and retry the request in
the form of a backwards-compatible [payment details](./payments) API call which
supports both SPSP and Open Payments.

## TODO

- Support for STREAM Receipts
